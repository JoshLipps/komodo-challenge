### Technology choices:
#### UI:
 - React
 - Typescript
 - styled-components
 - use component lib? - final if time permits so i can do before and after quickly
#### API : REST(Express) vs graphQL
 - node (bun or deno if time permits)
 - express vs ~~graphql~~ ......... REST is fast and easy...

#### DB:
- MongoDB vs ~~RDB~~ see: [DB](./DB.mb) for more details on this call
#### Models:
- Recipe
- Curation
- User?  (implied but not required by test)

### User Stories
- View all the recipes in my 'favorites' library.
- Create custom lists to organize my recipes.
- Display userâ€™s curated recipe lists.
### Backend
- Develop an API endpoint that provides the list of recipes for the user library. - GET /recipe
- Develop an API endpoint to add a recipe to a new or existing list - PUT /list/:id/recipe/:recipe_id
- Develop an API endpoint to fetch a list of curations - GET /list

### Frontend
- Build My Favorites page: to browse all the recipes of a user
- Build My Lists page: to present all curations, with each curation appearing as a
horizontal list with title and its associated recipes
- Implement a feature on the My Favorites page that enables users to add a recipe to a
new or existing list.

#### Run Project
```zsh
docker-compose up --build -d
```
