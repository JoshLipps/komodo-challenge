### Technology choices:
UI: React / Typescript / styled-components /// speed.... use component lib?
API : REST(Express) vs graphQL
DB: MongoDB vs RDB
Models: Recipe, Curation, User?

### User Stories
- View all the recipes in my 'favorites' library.
- Create custom lists to organize my recipes.
- Display userâ€™s curated recipe lists.
### Backend
- Develop an API endpoint that provides the list of recipes for the user library.
   GET /recipe
- Develop an API endpoint to add a recipe to a new or existing list
   PUT /list/:id/recipe/:recipe_id
- Develop an API endpoint to fetch a list of curations
   GET /list

### Frontend
- Build My Favorites page: to browse all the recipes of a user
- Build My Lists page: to present all curations, with each curation appearing as a
horizontal list with title and its associated recipes
- Implement a feature on the My Favorites page that enables users to add a recipe to a
new or existing list.
